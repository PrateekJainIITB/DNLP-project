## Project Overview

### Problem Statement
This project aims to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of two methods for generating Hindi image captions:
1. **Direct Captioning in Hindi**: Images are captioned directly in Hindi using a dedicated model.
2. **Two-Step Captioning via Translation**: English captions generated by a model are translated into Hindi using Google Translate.

The quality of the captions is assessed using BLEU scores.

### Motivation
- **Cultural Relevance**: Improves content accessibility for Hindi-speaking users.
- **Technical Challenge**: Enhances resource-limited language captioning.
- **Research Contribution**: Diversifies AI applications by addressing non-English languages.

## Methodology

### Data Handling
- **Dataset**: Hindi-vision-genome (29k images with Hindi and English captions).
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Resized images.
  - Tokenized captions for model input.
- **Dataset Sizes Evaluated**: 1k, 5k, 10k, 15k, and 20k images.

### Model Architecture
1. **Feature Extraction**: Pre-trained Inception v3 model extracts image features.
2. **Caption Generation**: LSTM-based decoder converts features into captions.

### Training Details
- **Loss Function**: Cross-entropy.
- **Optimizer**: Adam.
- **Hyperparameters**:
  - Learning Rate: 0.001
  - Batch Size: 64
  - Epochs: 12 (with early stopping)

## Evaluation Metrics

- **BLEU Scores**: Evaluated at BLEU-1 to BLEU-4 for n-gram quality.
- **Qualitative Measures**:
  - **Adequacy**: Key information conveyed.
  - **Fluency**: Linguistic quality.

---

## Results and Observations

1. **Quantitative**: BLEU-1 scores were promising, but higher n-grams (BLEU-2 to BLEU-4) declined, highlighting challenges with multi-word coherence.
2. **Qualitative**: Captions were often fluent but less adequate in conveying key details.
3. **Direct vs. Translation**: Direct Hindi captioning showed better fluency and adequacy compared to translated captions.
